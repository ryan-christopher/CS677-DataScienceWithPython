## Data Science with Python

This repository contains the work I have done for the class Data Science with Python at Boston University. Topics include numpy, pandas, linear models, decision trees, and more. 

The class is made up of weekly assignments as well as in class exercises, along with an end of semester project that will be covered later on.
