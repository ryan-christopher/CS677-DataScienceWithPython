'''
Goal - to train and fine tune a Decision Tree for the moons dataset
in sklearn (nice for testing classification algorithms)
'''

# generate a moons dataset using the make_moons() function in the datasets
# module with the arguments make_moons(n_samples = 10000, noise = 0.4)



# split into training and test set using train_test_split with a 
# 70-30 split



# adjust hyperparameter values until it doesn't look like the model
# is overfitting (try various values for max_leaf_nodes)



# measure performance on test set (best would be 85% to 87% accuracy)
