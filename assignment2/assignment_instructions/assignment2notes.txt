to find probability of a n up day, 
take number of days positive and divide by total number of days

for the ensemble, if 2 = +, 3 = -, and 4 = -, then
ensemble will be -, whatever the majority is for 2, 3, and 4

hint mentioned for question 2 - look at the shift method
(could mean make new column that is shifted by 1 day?)
